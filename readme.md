# README
This is a backup of the Positron Wiki site

If you stumbled upong this ON the wiki site, what are you doing here? get outta here - this is just for the GitHub Backup to explain to people who stumble upon the GitHub backup what the GitHub backup is. Capisci?

The Wiki is backed up to our GitHub repo every 5 minutes; https://github.com/Positron3D/Positron_Wiki

So, if anything happens, like TheNomad nuking the server again in some strange turn of events in where he was only trying to create a backup system that SYNCED to GitHub, then we can recover it forom that backup.

Yes. That Happened.

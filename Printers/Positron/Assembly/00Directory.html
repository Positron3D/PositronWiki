<h1>Colloquial Terms</h1>
<p>Let's be real, this printer is strange, so you will encounter some terminology that we use which may be confusing at first. Before we dive into the assembly guide, please preview the following terms;</p>
<h2>Deployed / Folded</h2>
<p>These terms are pretty straight forward, when the printer is <strong>Deployed</strong> it is unfolded and ready to print.</p>
<p>When the printer is <strong>Folded</strong> it is ready for storage in a Filament box or the included Travel/Pelican Case.</p>
<h2>The Glass Heat Bed</h2>
<p>We often refer to the “Back of the Bed” or “The Back Glass” as the side with the ITO coating. This is the side that faces <strong>UP</strong> when the printer is deployed.</p>
<p>The “Front of the Bed” is the printing surface, it is the side that faces <strong>DOWN</strong> when the printer is deployed.</p>
<h1>Assembly Guide</h1>
<p>We've estimated that Assembly will take around 10 hours (Minus printing the parts).</p>
<p>The LDO Assembly guide is the best starting point, and will walk you through the full assembly of the printer.;<br><a href="https://www.ldomotion.com/p/assembly/Positron-V32">https://www.ldomotion.com/p/assembly/Positron-V32</a></p>
<p>Guides here will outline modifications you can make to the base assembly.</p>
<h1>THE CAD</h1>

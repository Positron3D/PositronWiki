# Positron v3.2 Printed Parts
Hello - all of these folders are what is required to build your Postiron.

In each folder, you will find a readme, this will act as a general Key for the naming of the files, as well as a spot where we've added advisories for some parts. This is as simple as informing you if a part will not be seen from the exterior, if a part will be closely intact with a high temperature item such as a motor, or if a part is reccomended to be non-conductive for electrical isolation.

Please note that the folders here are grouped by assembly, and not by reccomended order of assembly. Please be sure to follow the guides provided on our wiki.

# Reccomended Print Settings

 - Line Width; 0.4
 - Layer Height; 0.2
 - Infill; 40%
 - Infill Patterns; Honeycomb, Gyroid, Cubic, Grid.
 - Perimeters; 5
 - Top/Bottom; 6 Layers
 - No Supports - All pieces requiring supports already have supports included.

  

ABS or ASA is the recommended filament for most parts, PLA and PETG can be used for many accent pieces.

# FILE NAME KEY:
Each file is named similar to the following;
`Part Name - Quantity - Recommended Color - Minimum Material Type - Notes`

### Example 1;
`Bed_Cable_Guide - 1x - Accent - PLA`  

This is the `Bed_Cable_Guide`, you need to print One of them, recommended in an accent color, and at the minimum in PLA.

### Example 2;
`Z_PCB_Spacer - 1x - Any - ABSorASA - Non-Conductive`

This is the `Z_PCB_Spacer`, you need to print One of them, you can use any color, at the minimum in ABS or ASA, and must not be conductive.

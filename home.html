<h1>Notice; August 1st - 2024</h1>
<p>We had a major server failure result in the loss of the wiki, thankfully we had a backup, but this resulted in many things getting moved around, and images being lost.</p>
<p>If you would like to help us develop the wiki, please join our Discord and let us know. We genuinely appreciate the help.</p>

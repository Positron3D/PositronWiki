# Notice; August 1st - 2024

We had a major server failure result in the loss of the wiki, thankfully we had a backup, but this resulted in many things getting moved around, and images being lost.

If you would like to help us develop the wiki, please join our Discord and let us know. We genuinely appreciate the help.
